When accessing the details of a feature flag, you will have access to two important pages: **History** and **Settings**.

The **Settings** page allows you to update various aspects of the flag, such as its name, description, and tags. Similar to other configuration tabs for feature flags, it is necessary to provide a comment explaining the changes before saving them. This ensures a record of the reasons behind each modification, helping to maintain clear and organized flag settings.

The **History** page provides a comprehensive report of all modifications made to the flag. Each time a user changes the flag, they are required to provide a comment explaining the modification. The History page lists all these modifications, including the changes and corresponding descriptions. You can also see the user who made each modification, providing transparency and accountability.
