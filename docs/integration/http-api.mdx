:::caution HTTP API (Alpha)

The HTTP API is currently in its alpha stage.

If you find any issues or have suggestions for improvement, feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/bucketeer-io/bucketeer/issues).<br />
All contributions are welcome!

:::

The Bucketeer HTTP API allows you to interact with the Bucketeer service programmatically. It supports operations such as creating, updating, and retrieving feature flags, managing users, and evaluating feature flags for specific users.

## Authentication
Bucketeer API uses token-based authentication. Each request must include an `authorization` header with the token:
```http
authorization: <your-api-key>
```

[API Key](/organization-settings/api-keys) can be created in the Bucketeer dashboard under Organization Settings.

## API specification

API reference is available [here](/api).
