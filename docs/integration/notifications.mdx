The Notifications feature on Bucketeer is designed to keep you and your team informed about important changes and events within your dashboard. **These notifications are automatically delivered to your Slack workspace whenever an event occurs**.

To configure notifications, access the **Settings** in the left dashboard menu and navigate to the **Notifications** tab. Here, you will find a list of previously condifured Notifications and the option to create new ones using the **+ Add** button.

## Create a notifications

When setting up a new notification, you will need to provide the following information:

- **Name**: Identifies the notification and make it easier when looking for it on the dashboard. Bucketeer recommends using descriptive names.
- **Type**: Specify the types of events that should trigger this notification. You can choose one or more event types.
- **Slack incoming webhook URL**: Define the incoming webhook URL to which the notifications will be sent. Refer to the [Sending messages using Incoming Webhooks](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks) guide for instructions on creating an app and configuring webhooks. Once you've designated the appropriate channel or account for receiving notifications, you will obtain the webhook URL.

Refer to the table below for a list of event types, along with descriptions and triggering conditions.
