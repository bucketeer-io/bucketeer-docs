This section provides information about developer tools for programmatic access to Bucketeer.

## HTTP API

The [HTTP API](/developer-tools/http-api) allows you to interact with Bucketeer programmatically, enabling you to read and write data from your applications, CI/CD pipelines, or custom automation tools.

:::info Organization Settings vs Developer Tools

**Organization Settings** (Slack notifications, FCM pushes, members, API keys) are now located in the Organization Settings section, accessible via the gear icon in the sidebar.
