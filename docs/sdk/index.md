In this category, you will find guides explaining the difference between **client** and **server-side** SDKs. To connect to the Bucketeer server, you will need an SDK for your programming language and an API key.

We strongly recommend that you check our [Quickstart](/getting-started/quickstart) guide before using Bucketeer SDKs in your application.

### Client-side SDK

Client-side SDKs are developed for single-user desktop, mobile, and embedded applications, including mobile SDKs.

Supported SDKs for client-side:

- [Android](/sdk/client-side/android)
- [iOS](/sdk/client-side/ios)
- [JavaScript](/sdk/client-side/javascript)
- [Flutter](/sdk/client-side/flutter)

### Server-side SDK

Server-side SDKs are built for multi-user systems in secure environments like web servers. This setup enables server-side SDKs to receive flag data including rules, and segments safely without filtering out sensitive information.

Supported SDKs for server-side:

- [Go](/sdk/server-side/go)
- [NodeJS](/sdk/server-side/node-js)
