The auto operation feature handles the manipulation of feature flag configurations on your behalf. It executes specific operations automatically based on the conditions set by the user.

To access the auto operation page go to the Feature Flag detail page and click on the **Auto Operation** tab. You can check the active and completed operations.

## How auto operation works

The auto operation feature consists of two key elements:

- **Operation**: An operation refers to an action that impacts a feature flag. Each action is linked to one or more triggering conditions. When a condition is met, the associated operation's action is executed. Currently, Bucketeer supports two types of operations:

  - **Enable**: Enables the chosen flag when the condition is met. You can release using the **[schedule](/feature-flags/creating-feature-flags/auto-operation/schedule)** or **[progressive rollout](/feature-flags/creating-feature-flags/auto-operation/rollout)** options.
  - **Kill Switch**: Disables the chosen flag when the condition is met. You can disable it using the **[schedule](/feature-flags/creating-feature-flags/auto-operation/schedule)** or **[event rate](/feature-flags/creating-feature-flags/auto-operation/event-rate)**.

- **Condition**: A condition specifies the circumstances under which the operation is triggered. Multiple conditions can be associated with a single killing operation. On the other hand, only one condition can be related to enabling a feature. Similarly, each rollout phase is linked to a condition. It's important to note that the corresponding operation is triggered if any conditions are satisfied.

Based on the operations and condition the auto operation works as:

1. The server monitors the specified conditions.
2. When a condition is met, the corresponding operation is executed.
3. After enabling or disabling the associated flag, the triggered operation's status changes from active to complete.
4. The operation is moved from the Active to the Completed panel, indicating that it has been executed.

## Conditions

As mentioned, a condition must be fulfilled to trigger an auto operation. Currently, Bucketeer provides three condition options, which you can use to configure auto operations in your application:

- [Schedule](/feature-flags/creating-feature-flags/auto-operation/schedule):: Specify the date and time to enable or kill a flag.
- [Progressive rollout](/feature-flags/creating-feature-flags/auto-operation/rollout): Determine a strategy to release a feature flag variation progressively.
- [Event rate](/feature-flags/creating-feature-flags/auto-operation/event-rate): Define conditions to kill a flag based on the rate of a particular event.
