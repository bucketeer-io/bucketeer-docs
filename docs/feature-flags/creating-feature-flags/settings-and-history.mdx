import CenteredImg from '@site/src/components/centered-img/CenteredImg';

When accessing feature flag details, the **Settings** and **History** tabs provide configuration management and change tracking.

## Settings

Update your flag's configuration including maintainer, name, description, and tags. All changes require a comment to maintain clear documentation.

<CenteredImg
  imgURL="img/feature-flags/settings-history/settings.png"
  alt="Settings panel"
  wSize="100%"
/>

### Clone Flag
Creates a copy of the flag with the same targeting configuration and on/off state. You select the destination environment where the cloned flag will be created.

### Archive Flag
Archives the flag in the current environment. Archived flags only appear when the Archived filter is selected in the flag list.

## History

The History tab shows a complete audit trail of all flag modifications. Each change includes:
- The user who made the change
- Timestamp
- Required comment explaining the modification
- Full JSON diff showing exactly what changed

<CenteredImg
  imgURL="img/feature-flags/settings-history/history.png"
  alt="History panel"
  wSize="100%"
/>

Use the **Changes** and **Snapshot** tabs to view modifications as either a diff or the complete flag state at that point in time.
