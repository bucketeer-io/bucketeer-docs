import CenteredImg from '@site/src/components/centered-img/CenteredImg';

The History tab shows a complete audit trail of all flag modifications. Each change includes:
- The user who made the change
- Timestamp
- Required comment explaining the modification
- Full JSON diff showing exactly what changed

<CenteredImg
  imgURL="img/feature-flags/settings-history/history.png"
  alt="History panel"
  wSize="100%"
/>

Use the **Changes** and **Snapshot** tabs to view modifications as either a diff or the complete flag state at that point in time.
