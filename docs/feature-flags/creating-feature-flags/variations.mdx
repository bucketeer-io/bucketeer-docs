The Variations tab allows you to manage variations for your feature flag with ease. You can add, edit, or remove variations based on your requirements.

To access the variations page on the Bucketeer dashboard, access the **Feature Flags** tab, choose the desired flag, and click on its name. On the new page, select the **Variation** tab on the top. The image below presents an example of the **Variations** page for a boolean flag.

For boolean flags, you can modify the name and description of each variation. When dealing with multivariate flags (string, number, JSON, and YAML types), you can add or delete variations as needed in addition to editing the value, name, and description of variations. After finishing the flag variations edition, save it and provide a comment describing your changes.

:::info Restrictions to change variations

You can't delete a variation if:
- It was selected as the **Default Rule** or as the **OFF variation** on the **Targeting** tab
- It has users assigned in **Individual Targeting**
- It's assigned to any **Custom Rules** (either as a fixed variation or with a rollout percentage greater than 0%)
- It's used as a prerequisite or in a rule condition of another feature flag
- You have an active [progressive rollout](/feature-flags/creating-feature-flags/auto-operation/progressive-rollout) with the current flag
- Only 2 variations remain (flags must have at least 2 variations)

**Note:** If a variation has a rollout percentage of 0% in a custom rule or default rule, it can be deleted since it's not actively serving users.

You can edit the values, names, and descriptions of existing variations even during an active progressive rollout.

:::

## Deleting Variations

When you successfully delete a variation:
- Its individual targeting entry will be removed automatically
- It will be removed from custom rules where it has 0% rollout weight
- The flag's configuration remains valid and functional
