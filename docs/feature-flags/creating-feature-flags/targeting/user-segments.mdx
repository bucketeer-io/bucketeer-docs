User segments allow you to target predefined groups of users by their unique IDs. This is perfect for beta testing, VIP users, or managing cohorts without manually listing IDs in each flag.

## What Are User Segments?

A user segment enables you to create user groups based on the unique ID of end users defined when initializing the Bucketeer SDK. It allows you to create specific user targets to manage all users for a single feature flag variation or beta tests on a small number of users.

You can learn more about creating, managing, and use cases by accessing the [Segments](/feature-flags/segments) page.

## How Segment-Based Rules Work

You can create segments based on various criteria, such as email type, gender, location, and more. This allows you to precisely target and group users for testing purposes.

Once you've created a segment, you can use it in your targeting rules to assign variations to all users in that segment.

## Example: Targeting a Segment

The image below shows a custom rule where the **value-1** variation is returned if the requesting user belongs to the **Testing Users** segment:

## Common Use Cases

- **Beta testing** - Create a "Beta Testers" segment and give them early access
- **VIP features** - Target premium users with exclusive functionality
- **Internal testing** - Segment for employees or QA team members
- **Regional rollouts** - Segments based on geographic location
- **Customer cohorts** - Target specific customer groups (e.g., "High-value customers", "Trial users")
- **Troubleshooting** - Quickly enable/disable features for affected users

## Benefits Over Individual Targeting

While [Individual Targeting](/feature-flags/creating-feature-flags/targeting#individual-targeting) requires you to add user IDs directly to each flag, segments allow you to:

- **Manage user groups centrally** - Update the segment once, affects all flags using it
- **Reuse across flags** - One segment can be used in multiple feature flags
- **Easier maintenance** - Add/remove users from the segment without touching individual flags
- **Bulk operations** - Upload CSV files with thousands of user IDs at once
