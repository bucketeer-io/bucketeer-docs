Individual Targeting allows you to define which specific users will receive each feature flag variation. You provide the **User IDs** for the users who will receive the selected variation, and these users will get the assigned variation regardless of any other rules or rollout conditions.

## How Individual Targeting Works

For a boolean flag example, you could provide specific user IDs (e.g., `user-123`, `user-456`, `qa-tester-1`) to receive the `True` variation, and a different set of user IDs to receive the `False` variation. These individually targeted users will receive their assigned variation regardless of any other rules or rollout conditions.

## Common Use Cases

- **Internal testing** - Target your team members for early access
- **VIP customers** - Provide exclusive features to specific premium users
- **Beta testers** - Enable features for selected test users
- **Debugging** - Test variations with specific problematic user accounts
- **Demo accounts** - Control exact feature visibility for demonstration purposes

## Best Practices

:::info Platform-based Targeting
For platform-based targeting (e.g., targeting all Android vs iOS users), use **Custom Rules** with user attributes instead of Individual Targeting. Individual Targeting is specifically designed for targeting by unique user IDs.
:::

:::tip When to Use
- Use Individual Targeting for **small numbers of specific users**
- Use Custom Rules with user segments for **larger groups of users**
- Use Custom Rules with attributes for **platform or property-based targeting**
:::

:::caution Maintenance
Individually targeted users must be updated manually. For frequently changing user groups, consider using User Segments or Custom Rules with attributes instead.
