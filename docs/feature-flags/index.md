This section presents the necessary information to use Bucketeer feature flags. On this page, you find an organized overview of the content covered in this section, providing a step-by-step guide on effectively creating and utilizing flags. Below you find the links and a brief description for each section.

## Creating feature flags:

- [Create a feature flag](../feature-flags/creating-feature-flags/create-feature-flag): Learn how to create flags and define their properties.
- [Targeting with feature flags](../feature-flags/creating-feature-flags/targeting): Discover how to target specific users or groups with your flags based on various attributes.
- [Manage variations](../feature-flags/creating-feature-flags/manage-variations): Understand how to manage and configure different variations of your feature flags.
- [Auto operation](../feature-flags/creating-feature-flags/auto-operation): Automate the feature flag operation.
- [Evaluate results](../feature-flags/creating-feature-flags/evaluate-results): Explore how to evaluate and analyze the usage of your flags.
- [Other flag settings](../feature-flags/creating-feature-flags/other-flag-settings): Explore additional settings and options for your flags.

## API keys

The [API keys](/feature-flags/api-keys) describe what they're and how they're used to authenticate and control access to the Bucketeer system.

## Testing with flags

The [Testing with flags](../feature-flags/testing-with-flags) will cover the three components used to perform tests on the Bucketeer system:

- [Goals](../feature-flags/goals): Discover how to define goals for your feature flag experiments to measure their success.
- [Experiments](../feature-flags/experiments): Learn how to set up and run experiments using feature flags to test hypotheses and gather insights.
- [Using Experiments](../feature-flags/using-experiments): Explore best practices and techniques for effectively utilizing experiments in your development process.
