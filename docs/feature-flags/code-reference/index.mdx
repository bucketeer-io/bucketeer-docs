CodeReference is a CLI tool that scans source code repositories to detect where feature flags are used. The CodeReference analyzes the codebase and sends the results to the Bucketeer dashboard, providing your teams with precise information into where the feature flag are used in your code. CodeReference helps maintain clean, efficient code by identifying stale or unused feature flags and directing developers to the exact locations where they need to take action.

By using CodeReference you can:

- Automate the detection of feature flags across your codebase.  
- Integration it with CI/CD pipilines to scan repositories.  
- Use it with GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket repositories.  
- Configuration it using command-line flags, environment variables, and YAML configuration.  
- Improve your codebase code hygiene, reducing technical debt by identifying obsolete or inactive flags.  

Use the following options to learn how to configure and use CodeReference or to access the scan results:

<ButtonShelf>
  <Button
    redirect="/feature-flags/code-reference/configuration"
    title="Configure and Use"
    info="Learn how to configure and use CodeReference."
  />
  <Button
    redirect="/feature-flags/code-reference/scan-results"
    title="Access Scan Results"
    info="Learn how to access the scan results from CodeReference."
  />
</ButtonShelf>
