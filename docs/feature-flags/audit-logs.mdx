The Audit Logs feature stores all log history from the current Environment. You can use the logs to identify problems, or who performed modification in your project flags. 

To check the logs, access the **Audit Logs** page from the sidebar menu. To check logs from other environments, you first need to change to the desired environment and then access the Audit Logs page.

## Filtering logs

By default, the Audit Logs displays the most recent entries. However, you can use the **Sort** button at the top right corner to switch to the **Oldest** first if you need.

To make it easier to inspect and find problems source, the Bucketeer system provides several filters you can use to find desired logs. The complete filter options is listed below:

- **Email**: User email who performed the change, such as changing a flag variation.
- **Date**: Specify a date range when the logs were created.

/>

- **Entity**: Select the type of entity related to the log source. You can use this option to filter logs related only to changes in Goals, for example. The complete list is presented next:
    - Feature Flag
    - Goal
    - Experiment
    - User Segment
    - Account
    - API Key
    - Auto Operation
    - Progressive Rollout
    - Push
    - Subscription
