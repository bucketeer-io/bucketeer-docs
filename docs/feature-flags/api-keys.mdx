The API keys authorizes and control access to the feature flag management system, providing authentication capabilities that ensure secure connections between your application and the server.

Each API key is associated with a specific environment, allowing you to identify and link your application to the desired user group.

## Key Roles

In Bucketeer, when you create an API key, you have to select a key role. The Key Role defines the permissions and access levels associated with the API key. The available roles are:

- **Client SDK:** Allows all SDKs to evaluate end users on the Bucketeer server.
- **Server SDK:** Allows server SDKs to evaluate end users locally within the SDK.
- **Public API(Read Only):** This role allows you to read the data in Bucketeer.
- **Public API(Read and Write):** This role allows you to read and write the data in Bucketeer.
- **Public API(Admin):** This role allows you to read and write the data including admin settings in Bucketeer.

:::info Server SDK Evaluation Options

When using server SDKs, you have two evaluation options:

- **Local evaluation (Server SDK key):** The SDK evaluates users locally within your application. This provides the fastest response times and reduces server load.
- **Remote evaluation (Client SDK key):** The SDK sends evaluation requests to the Bucketeer backend. Use this if you need centralized evaluation or don't want to maintain local state.

Choose the API key role that matches your evaluation strategy.

## Creating an API Key

To create an API key, you need to be an Admin or have an environment account with the Owner role. Other members can see the API keys but can't manage them.

To generate a new API key, access the API Keys panel page and click the **+ New API Key** button. Then, provide a descriptive name for the key, select the Environment in which the key will be used, and choose the appropriate Key Role based on your requirements. Finally, click the **Create API Key** button to generate the API key.

:::tip

Choose a meaningful name for the API key based on its associated feature or project to make it easy to manage. Avoid random names, as they can cause confusion and make it difficult to identify where the API key is used.

## Manage your API Keys

Once an API key is created, it becomes immediately available for use and is set to the **ON** state. In addition, it grants access to all feature flags within the current environment. The Bucketeer dashboard does not offer a direct option to delete API keys. However, if a key is no longer required, you can toggle its state to **OFF** using the available switch button in the **API Keys** tab. This action will result in denying all SDK requests using that specific key.
