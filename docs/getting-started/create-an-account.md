Bucketeer allows you to manage and track data related to different environments. To begin using Bucketeer, you need an account. For additional information regarding the available account types on Bucketeer, check the [Bucketeer account types](../best-practice/account-types). Ask the project administrator to create an account if you're a new team member.

The following steps show how to create an account as an Admin.

1. Click on the gear icon on the sidebar menu.
2. Select **Members**.
3. Click **+ Invite Member** button to add a new account.

4. Enter the new member's email and define their role.
