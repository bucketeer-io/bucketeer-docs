Bucketeer allows you to manage and track data related to different environments. To begin using Bucketeer, you need an account. For additional information regarding the available account types on Bucketeer, check the [Bucketeer account types](../best-practice/account-types). Ask the project administrator to create an account if you're a new team member.

The following steps show how to create an account as an Admin.

1. Click on the gear icon on the sidebar menu.
2. Select **Members**.
3. Click **+ Invite Member** button to add a new account.

4. Enter the new member's email and define their role.

    :::info Teams
    You can create teams and assign members to it.
    
    Use teams to group members, making it easier when listing them on the list page.

    :::info Role Member

     When you assign the role Member to a new account, the owner can only access information related to the Environment you choose. These users are unable to create or update organization settings, projects, environments, API keys, or members.

5. Click **Invite Member** to create the account.

:::info

The new member's email must be a Gmail Account. Otherwise, the new member will not have access to the dashboard.

:::

Once the account is created, the Admin needs to contact the new member, informing them that they can access the dashboard. No notification email is sent to the new member after their account creation.
