To begin using Bucketeer, team members need to be invited to your organization. Organization Admins and Owners can invite new members and assign them appropriate roles and environment access.

If you're a new team member, ask your organization administrator to invite you.

## Inviting a Member

The following steps show how to invite a member as an Admin or Owner:

1. Click on the gear icon on the bottom of the sidebar menu.
2. Select **Members** from the Access section.
3. Click **+ Invite Member** button.

  alt='Navigate to Members'

/>

4. Enter the new member's email and define their role.

    :::info Teams
    You can create teams and assign members to it.

    Use teams to group members, making it easier when listing them on the list page.
    :::

    :::info Member Role
     When you assign the **Member** role, the user can only access the environments you explicitly choose. These users are unable to create or update organization settings, projects, environments, or manage organization-level resources like API keys and members.

5. Click **Invite Member** to send the invitation.
