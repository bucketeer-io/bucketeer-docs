Bucketeer allows you to manage and track data related to different environments. To begin using Bucketeer, you need an account. Ask the project administrator to create an account if you are a new team member.

The following steps show how to create an account as an Admin.

1. Select the target environment from the select menu on the top left.
2. Navigate to the **Accounts** page from the sidebar menu.
3. Click **+ Add** button to add a new account.

  alt='Account dashboard tab'
  wSize='100%'
/>

4. Enter the new member's email and define his role.
5. Click **Submit** to create the account.

The new member's email must be a Gmail Account. Otherwise, the user will not have access to the dashboard.

:::

Once the account is created, the Admin needs to contact the new member, letting him know he can access the dashboard. No notification email is sent to the new member after their account creation.
