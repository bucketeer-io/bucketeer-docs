Integrating Bucketeer with your application is a simple process that is the same across all SDKs. Bucketeer has multiple SDKs available, and you can refer to the [Choose an SDK](./choose-sdk.md) guide to determine which one best suits your needs. To integrate Bucketeer into your application, follow these steps:

1. **Install the Bucketeer SDK**: Use your project's dependency manager to install or implement the Bucketeer SDK in your application, allowing it to access the Bucketeer SDK and its features.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="gradle" label="Android">

```groovy showLineNumbers
dependencies {
  implementation 'io.bucketeer:android-client-sdk:LATEST_VERSION'
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yaml" label="Flutter">

```yaml showLineNumbers
dependencies:
  bucketeer_flutter_client_sdk: LATEST_VERSION
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="swift" label="iOS">

```swift showLineNumbers
use_frameworks!

target 'YOUR_TARGET_NAME' do
  pod 'Bucketeer', 'LATEST_VERSION'
end
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="npm" label="JavaScript (npm)">

```sh showLineNumbers
npm install @bucketeer/sdk
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yarn" label="JavaScript (Yarn)">

```sh showLineNumbers
yarn add @bucketeer/sdk
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

2. **Import the Bucketeer Client**: In your application's code, import the Bucketeer client, the primary interface to interact with the Bucketeer SDK, and communicate with the Bucketeer service. Each SDK guide covers this step and the previous one in detail. Access the [SDKs](../sdk/) page to get more information.

```kotlin showLineNumbers
import io.bucketeer.sdk.android.*
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="dart" label="Flutter">

```dart showLineNumbers
import 'package:bucketeer_flutter_client_sdk/bucketeer_flutter_client_sdk.dart';
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="swift" label="Swift">

```swift showLineNumbers
import Bucketeer
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

```js showLineNumbers
import {
  BKTClient,
  getBKTClient,
  defineBKTConfig,
  defineBKTUser,
  initializeBKTClient,
} from '@bucketeer/sdk';
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

3. **Configure the Bucketeer Client**: Provide the credentials for your environment to configure the Bucketeer client. These credentials uniquely identify your project and environment and authorize your application to connect with Bucketeer. Here is the description of each required information:

   - API key: This is a unique key that grants access to Bucketeer. If you haven't done so, you can create an API key by following the instructions in the [Create an API key](../create-an-api-key) guide.
   - API URL: The Administrator will provide you with the API URL when your user account is created. It serves as the endpoint for your application to connect with Bucketeer's API.
   - User ID: This refers to the ID of the end user who will be utilizing the application integrated with Bucketeer. It's important to note that the User ID corresponds to the end user, not the user accessing the admin console or dashboard.
   - Feature tag: When creating a feature flag in Bucketeer, you define a feature tag associated with it. This tag helps identify the specific feature flag within Bucketeer.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="kt" label="Android">

```kotlin showLineNumbers
val config = BKTConfig.builder()
  .apiKey("YOUR_API_KEY")
  .apiEndpoint("YOUR_API_ENDPOINT")
  .featureTag("YOUR_FEATURE_TAG")
  .build()

val user = BKTUser.builder()
  .id("USER_ID")
  .build()
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="dart" label="Flutter">

```dart showLineNumbers
final config = BKTConfigBuilder()
  .apiKey("YOUR_API_KEY")
  .apiURL("YOUR_API_URL")
  .featureTag("YOUR_FEATURE_TAG")
  .build();

final user = BKTUserBuilder
  .id("USER_ID")
  .build();
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="swift" label="iOS">

```swift showLineNumbers
let config = BKTConfig(
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  apiURL: "YOUR_API_URL",
  featureTag: "YOUR_FEATURE_TAG"
)

let user = BKTUser(id: "USER_ID")
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

```js showLineNumbers
const config = defineBKTConfig({
  apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY',
  apiEndpoint: 'YOUR_API_URL',
  featureTag: 'YOUR_FEATURE_TAG',
  appVersion: 'YOUR_APP_VERSION',
});

const user = defineBKTUser({
  id: 'USER_ID',
});
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

4. **Assign Feature Flag Variations**: The variation method allows you to control whether a feature flag is enabled or disabled for specific users. By using the feature flag ID, you can associate different variations of the flag with different users. Each feature flag has a unique ID, which enables you to determine which variation of the flag a user will see in your application.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="kt" label="Android">

```kotlin showLineNumbers
val showNewFeature = client.booleanVariation("YOUR_FEATURE_FLAG_ID", false)
if (showNewFeature) {
    // The Application code to show the new feature
} else {
    // The code to run when the feature is off
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="dart" label="Flutter">

```dart showLineNumbers
final showNewFeature = await client.boolVariation("YOUR_FEATURE_FLAG_ID", false);
if (showNewFeature) {
    // The Application code to show the new feature
} else {
    // The code to run if the feature is off
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="swift" label="iOS">

```swift showLineNumbers
let client = BKTClient.get()!
let showNewFeature = client.boolVariation(featureID: "YOUR_FEATURE_FLAG_ID", defaultValue: false)
if (showNewFeature) {
    // The Application code to show the new feature
} else {
    // The code to run when the feature is off
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

```js showLineNumbers
const showNewFeature = client.boolVariation('YOUR_FEATURE_FLAG_ID', false);
if (showNewFeature) {
  // The Application code to show the new feature
} else {
  // The code to run when the feature is off
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

By following these steps, you can successfully integrate Bucketeer into your application and take advantage of its powerful feature flag management capabilities.
