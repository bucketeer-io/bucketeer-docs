On this page your find information about what are API Keys, how to create them and their role on Bucketeer system.

## What are API Keys

When working with flags in Bucketeer, API keys are essential. They authorize and control access to the feature flag management system, providing authentication capabilities that ensure secure connections between your application and the Bucketeer management service. Each API key is associated with a specific project and environment, allowing you to identify and link your application to the desired context. By requiring a valid API key for accessing the flag information, the security and integrity of the system is maintained, reducing the risk of unauthorized entry or manipulation with feature flag configurations.

## Creating an API Key

To create an API Key you need to be an Admin member or have an enviroment account with the Owner role. Other members can only see the APY keys, but can't manage them.
