The Members page allows you to invite team members to your organization, assign roles, and manage their permissions across environments.

## Accessing Members

1. Click the gear icon at the bottom of the left sidebar
2. Select **Members** from the Access section

  alt="Members list"
  wSize="100%"
/>

The Members page displays all organization members with:
- **Name** - Member's display name
- **Email** - Member's email address
- **Organization Role** - Owner, Admin, or Member
- **Teams** - Assigned teams
- **Status** - Enabled or Disabled
- **Created** - When the member was added

## Understanding Roles

Bucketeer uses a two-tier role system: **Organization Roles** and **Environment Roles**. Projects do not have their own permission roles.

### Organization Roles

Organization roles define what a member can do at the organization level:

| Role | Permissions |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Owner** | Full access to all organization settings, projects, and environments. Can manage all members and settings. |
| **Admin** | Can manage organization settings, projects, environments, members, and API keys. Cannot change owner's email. |
| **Member** | Access limited to assigned environments only. Cannot manage organization settings. |

### Environment Roles

When a member has the **Member** organization role, you must assign specific environment roles:

| Role | Permissions |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Editor** | Can create, update, and manage feature flags, experiments, goals, and segments within assigned environments. |
| **Viewer** | Read-only access to feature flags and data in assigned environments. Cannot modify any settings. |

:::tip Role Hierarchy
- **Owner/Admin** roles have automatic access to all environments
- **Member** roles require explicit environment assignments
- You can assign different roles per environment (e.g., Editor in Development, Viewer in Production)
:::

## Inviting New Members

### Member Invitation Process

1. You send an invitation from the Members page
2. The invited person receives an email with an invitation link
3. They click the link to accept the invitation and access the dashboard
4. Their account is activated with the assigned roles

## Managing Teams

Teams are optional groupings that help organize members. They make it easier to filter and manage members in large organizations.

When inviting or editing a member, you can assign them to a team. Teams are created automatically when you first use a team name. Use consistent team names across members.

## Managing Members

### Updating Member Roles

To update a member's role or environment access:

1. Click on the member in the members list
2. Modify their **Organization Role** or **Environment Roles**
3. Click **Update Member**

:::info Permission Required
Only **Organization Admin** and **Organization Owner** roles can manage members. Owners can manage all members including other Owners, while Admins cannot modify Owner accounts.
:::

### Disabling Members

To temporarily revoke a member's access:

1. Click on the member to edit
2. Toggle their status to **Disabled**
3. Confirm the change

:::warning Disabled Members
Disabled members cannot log in or access any part of the Bucketeer dashboard.
:::

### Deleting Members

To permanently remove a member:

1. Click on the member to edit
2. Click the **Delete** button
3. Confirm the deletion

:::caution Deleting Members
Deleting a member permanently removes them from the organization. This action cannot be undone.
:::

## Environment Access Control

When assigning the **Member** organization role, you must specify which environments they can access and what role they have in each environment.

### Assigning Environment Access

1. Select **Member** as the organization role
2. In the Environment Roles section, choose environments from the list
3. For each environment, assign either **Editor** or **Viewer** role
4. You can assign different roles for different environments

## Searching and Filtering

Use the search and filter options to manage large teams:

- **Search** - Find members by name or email
- **Team Filter** - Show members from specific teams
- **Role Filter** - Filter by organization role (Owner, Admin, Member)
- **Status Filter** - Show enabled or disabled members
