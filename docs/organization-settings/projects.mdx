Projects are the primary organizational unit in Bucketeer. Each project contains multiple environments (such as Development, Staging, and Production) where you manage your feature flags, experiments, and user segments.

### Hierarchy Structure

```
Organization
└── Project (e.g., "Mobile App")
    ├── Development Environment
    ├── Production Environment
    └── [Additional Environments...]
```

## Accessing Projects

1. Click the gear icon at the bottom of the left sidebar
2. Select **Projects** from the General section

<CenteredImg
  imgURL="img/organization-settings/projects-list.png"
  alt="Projects list"
  wSize="100%"
/>

## Creating a Project

To create a new project:

1. Navigate to the **Projects** page in Organization Settings
2. Click the **+ New Project** button
3. Fill in the project information:
   - **Name** - A descriptive name for your project
   - **URL Code** - A unique identifier (auto-generated from name, cannot be changed later)
   - **Description** (Optional) - Additional context about the project
4. Click **Create Project**

<CenteredImg
  imgURL="img/organization-settings/create-project-modal.png"
  alt="Create project modal"
  wSize="400px"
  borderWidth="1px"
/>

### Default Environments

When you create a project, Bucketeer automatically creates two environments:

1. **Development** - URL Code: `development`
2. **Production** - URL Code: `production`

You can create additional environments after the project is created.

## Managing Projects

### Updating a Project

To update an existing project:

1. Click on the project in the projects list
2. Modify the **Name** or **Description** (URL Code cannot be changed)
3. Click **Update Project**

### Disabling a Project

You can disable a project to temporarily prevent access:

1. Click on the project to edit
2. Toggle the project status to **Disabled**
3. Confirm the change

:::warning Disabling Projects
When a project is disabled, all its environments become inaccessible. Feature flags in disabled projects will not be evaluated.

## Permissions

Only **Organization Admin** and **Organization Owner** roles can create or modify projects. Projects do not have their own permission roles - access is controlled by organization roles and environment-specific roles.
