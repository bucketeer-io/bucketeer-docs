Environments are logical groupings within a project where you manage your feature flags, experiments, and user segments. Each environment represents a different stage of your development lifecycle, such as Development, Staging, or Production.

When you create a project, Bucketeer automatically creates two default environments: **Development** and **Production**. You can create additional environments as needed for your workflow.

## Accessing Environments

Navigate to your project (outside of Organization Settings) and click the **Environments** tab.

## Creating an Environment

To create a new environment:

1. Navigate to your project (outside of Organization Settings)
2. Click the **Environments** tab
3. Click **+ Create Environment**
4. Fill in the environment information:
   - **Name** - A descriptive name for the environment (e.g., "Staging", "QA", "Testing")
   - **URL Code** - A unique identifier (auto-generated from name, cannot be changed later)
   - **Description** (Optional) - Additional context about the environment
   - **Require Comment** (Optional) - When enabled, users must add a comment when making changes to feature flags
5. Click **Create Environment**

  alt="Create environment modal"
  wSize="400px"
  borderWidth="1px"
/>

:::caution URL Code is Permanent
The URL code cannot be changed after environment creation. Verify it carefully before creating the environment.

## Environment Settings

### Require Comment

The "Require Comment" setting forces users to provide a reason when making changes to feature flags in this environment. This is useful for:

- Production environments where changes need documentation
- Compliance and audit requirements
- Team communication and change tracking

When enabled, users must enter a comment in a text field before saving any feature flag changes.

## Managing Environments

### Switching Between Environments

Use the menu in the top left sidebar to switch between projects and environments. This menu allows you to:
- Switch between different projects
- Switch between environments within the current project

<CenteredImg

  alt="Switch between projects and environments"
  wSize="50%"
/>

Each environment has its own isolated set of feature flags, experiments, goals, and user segments.

### Updating an Environment

To update an existing environment:

1. Navigate to the environment settings
2. Modify the **Name**, **Description**, or **Require Comment** setting
3. Save your changes

:::caution URL Code Cannot Be Changed
The URL Code is a permanent identifier that cannot be modified after environment creation.

## Environment Access Control

Access to environments is controlled through member roles:

- **Organization Owner/Admin** - Automatic access to all environments
- **Member with Environment Editor role** - Can manage feature flags and settings in assigned environments
- **Member with Environment Viewer role** - Read-only access to assigned environments

Environment access is assigned when inviting or editing members. See [Members](/organization-settings/members) for more details.

## Permissions

Only **Organization Admin** and **Organization Owner** roles can create or modify environments.
