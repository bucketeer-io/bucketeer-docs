When setting up a new notification, you will need to provide the following information:

- **Name** - Identifies the notification and makes it easier when looking for it on the dashboard.
- **Slack incoming webhook URL** - Define the incoming webhook URL to which the notifications will be sent. Refer to the [Sending messages using Incoming Webhooks](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks) guide for instructions on creating an app and configuring webhooks.
- **Environment** - Select the environment to monitor for events.
- **Language** - Choose the language for notification messages.
- **Type** - Specify the types of events that should trigger this notification. You can choose one or more event types.
- **Feature Flag Tags** (Optional) - If you select the "Feature Flag" event type, you can optionally filter notifications to only flags with specific tags.

Refer to the table below for a list of event types, along with descriptions and triggering conditions.
