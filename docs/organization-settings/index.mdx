Organization Settings is the central hub for managing your Bucketeer organization. This section covers all administrative tasks including managing projects, team members, API keys, and integrations.

## Accessing Organization Settings

To access Organization Settings:

1. Click the gear icon at the bottom of the left sidebar
2. The settings menu will slide out, showing three main sections:
   - **General**: Organization settings and projects
   - **Access**: Members and API keys  
   - **Integrations**: Slack notifications and FCM pushes

## Organization Settings Overview

Organization Settings are separate from environment-level features. While feature flags, experiments, and segments are managed at the environment level, organization settings apply across all projects and environments.

### What You Can Manage

- **[Settings](/organization-settings/settings)** - Configure organization name, URL code, description, and owner
- **[Projects](/organization-settings/projects)** - Create and manage projects that contain multiple environments
- **[Environments](/organization-settings/environments)** - Create and configure environments within projects
- **[Members](/organization-settings/members)** - Invite team members and manage their roles and permissions
- **[API Keys](/organization-settings/api-keys)** - Create and manage API keys for SDK authentication
- **[Slack](/organization-settings/notifications)** - Set up Slack notifications for important events
- **[FCM](/organization-settings/pushes)** - Configure Firebase Cloud Messaging for real-time flag updates

## Permission Requirements

Most organization settings require specific permissions:

- **Organization Admin** or **Organization Owner**: Can manage all organization settings
- **Member** role: Can view settings but cannot modify them

:::tip
If you don't see the settings icon or certain menu options, check with your organization administrator about your role and permissions.

## Settings vs. Environment Features

It's important to understand the distinction between organization settings and environment features:

| Organization Settings | Environment Features |
| :--- | :--- |
| Projects, Members, API Keys | Feature Flags, Segments |
| Notifications, Pushes | Goals, Experiments |
| Organization-wide configuration | Environment-specific features |
| Requires Admin/Owner role | Configurable per environment role |

Understanding this structure helps you navigate Bucketeer efficiently and understand where to find specific features.
