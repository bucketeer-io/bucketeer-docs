In this section, you will find guidelines for using standard formatting codes correctly. Follow these recommendations and avoid common errors and make your content assertive.

## Code in text

When writing regular text, use a code font to indicate anything related to coding rather than exclusively using it in code samples.

In HTML, use the `<code>` element.
In Markdown, use backticks <code>`</code>.

Below are some examples of specific items that you can write in code font:

- Attribute names and values
- Command output (for example, `ping 192.160.100.2`)
- Data types
- Defined (constant) values for an element or attribute
- DNS record types
- Enum (enumerator) names
- Environment variable names
- Element names (XML and HTML)

    -Place angle brackets (`<>`) around the element name; you might have to escape the angle brackets to make them appear in the document.

- Filenames, filename extensions (if used), and paths
- Folders and directories
- HTTP verbs
- HTTP status codes
- HTTP content-type values
- IAM role names (for example, `functions/certain.admin`)
- Language keywords
- Method and function names
- Namespace aliases
- Placeholder variables
- Query parameter names and values
- Strings (such as URLs or domain names)

## Code samples

Here, you will find basic guidelines on how to format code samples:

- Don't use tabs to indent code; use spaces only.

- Wrap lines at 80 characters.

  - Wrap code lines at a smaller character count for easier reading on narrow browsers or printed documents.

- Mark code blocks as preformatted text. In HTML, use a `<pre>` element; in Markdown, indent every line of the code block by four spaces.

- Indicate omitted code using three dots and no spaces (...). Do not use the ellipsis character (â€¦). If the omission is one or more lines long, place the three dots on their own line. Do not format a sample with omitted code as a click-to-copy code block.

- When including code samples, it's helpful to introduce them with a sentence or paragraph.

  *Option 01. Use a colon if the sample follows the intro, and try to keep the same intro standard, for example:*

  - The following code sample shows how to use the `get` method:

    ```curl
    curl https://docs.bucketeer.io/
    ```

    For information about other methods, see [link].

  *Option 02. Use a period if there's more material (such as a note) between the introduction and the sample, for example:*

  - The following code sample shows how to use the `get` method. For information about other methods, see [link].

    ```curl
    curl https://docs.bucketeer.io/
    ```
